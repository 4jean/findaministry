PROVERBS11:16- BE TOUGH AND TENDER
A gracious woman retains honour but a ruthless man retains riches.

Riches and honour are two sides of the same coin both come from God. (1 Chronicles 29:12, proverbs 8:18). God does not want you to have riches without honour or honour without riches.

The above verse shows that graciousness (respect or kindness) is the way to retain honour. Many people attain honour but cannot retain it.
Graciousness keeps people dependent on you and loyal to you. it is more blessed to give than to receive. On the other hand, it takes ruthlessness (business mindedness) to retain riches. You have to compete, you have to get people to pay their debts; you must keeps records and track expenses. You must sell and make profits.

The problem is to think that I cannot be both gracious and ruthless. Graciousness may get you honour but it would not get you riches. Ruthlessness may get you riches but not honour. But God wants you to have both riches and honour, and that means it is possible to have both. But how can I have both if I have to be either gracious or ruthless. It would not work!

To have both riches and honour, I need to have both graciousness and ruthlessness. However, it is difficult to have both at the same time. LEARNING, MARRIAGE AND STAFFING MAKE IT HAPPEN.

When God brings a gracious woman (Abigail) and a ruthless man (Nabal) together, they will have both honour and riches. A ruthless man often gets a gracious wife and it is for the good of both. A gracious boss often has ruthless assistants. it is for the good of the business- to have both riches and honour . gracious people can learn to be businesslike and business minded people can learn graciousness also.

PROVERBS 11:17
The merciful man does good for his own soul But he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.
We should be thankful for the privilege to show mercy to another rather than receive thanks for things we have done. Although mercy is good done to another, it is really good done to self.

• Whatever a man sows, he reaps
• Everything returns to where it came from
• You will never fall into what you save others from. That is why the
Bible says, He who gives to the poor shall not lack.
• He who gives to the poor lends to the Lord, and what he has given
would be repaid.
• The merciful shall obtain mercy.

Properly understood, doing good to others is doing good to yourself. Similarly a cruel person is giving trouble to his own flesh. If you affect someones soul, you have affected yours, if you hurt someones flesh, you have hurt yours inadvertently.
If you are cruel to others and they are crying, your crying has been postdated and it would certainly come.

PROVERBS 11:18
The wicked man does deceptive work, but he who sows righteousness will have a sure reward.

The wicked does deceptive work. Deception work is something you cannot rely on. At the beginning, it seems to be a profitable work but in the longrun, it proves to be fake. Fake products are deceptive work! On the surface, it glitters but beneath the surface, it is a useless effort. The wicked CANNOT do a good work. Whatever comes from the wicked is deceptive work. Satan cannot truly bless any man or woman. Whatever he gives you today that makes you rejoice will soon bring sorrow to you.

Find out who your service man is. If he is a wicked man, you cannot count on his promises or trust the work he is doing or has done for you. An evil tree cannot produce a good fruit.

Since every man reaps what he sows, those who do deceptive work, reap deceptive work, reap deceptive harvest. Any good that comes to them would turn to evil. Eventually though he rejoices today, his joy shall be turned to mourning. Since he gives out evil in packets of good, he receives sorrow in wraps of joy.

What you get is a product of what you give or do; and what you do is a function of who you are. He who sow righteousness will have a SURE reward. A sure reward means a reward indeed, a lasting or durable good. it is not a fake reward but a sure or real one. Even if he gets evil, it would eventually turn to good; but righteous men get good-evil. Their sadness always turns to joy. For them, weeping may endure for a night, but joy surly comes in the morning.

PROVERBS 11:19
As righteousness leads to life, so he who pursues evil pursues it to his own death.

This verse reveals a truth that is assured here that righteousness leads to life. Righteousness is man`s bridge to life; righteousness is a means to an end. The verse also reveals that LIFE is an end or a destination.. righteousness is the way and guide to life.

THE NATURE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.
1 Righteousness is a state of righteous with God. (2cor 5:18) it be right with God is to be righteous. Righteousness is a state of being. It is the nature of God(in man)

2 Righteousness is a way of life or a life style righteousness is the life of the righteous. It is not what you do to become righteousness but what you do because you are righteous. It is not what you do because you want to be right with God. Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God`s- (I John 3:10)

3 Righteousness is a person. Jesus is our righteousness. He is the truth (the word) we believe to become righteous (Genesis 15:6). Jesus is also the righteousness (the way) that leads to leads to life, he is also the life and end of the journey. In John 14:6 Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life He said in other words, I am the way that begin with the truth and ends with the life. Truth is the beginning, life is the end but righteousness is the way connecting the truth and the life.

REVERSAL
As certainly as righteousness leads to life that is how wickedness leads to death. Wickedness is also a nature, a behavioral pattern and a person.
Wickedness embodied in Satan as righteousness is embodied in Christ. Righteousness and wickedness are not just region words, they are about life and death. Righteousness is the way to life. Wickedness (disharmony with God of truth) is the way to death. The irony is that men runs after death and think it is life. The grad deception is to give you death as though it is life. That was how man fell in Eden.

PROVERBS 11:20.
Those who are of a perverse heart are an abomination to the Lord. But the blameless in their way are His delight.

THESE WHO ARE PERVERSE.
No one is born perverse. Men learn or choose perversity. Perversity, which is turning Gods way upside down, comes when men choose to exercise their will contrary to Gods word or social norm. They try or choose the opposite way as their norm. Then, they begin to teach others their way. Examples of perversity are homosexuality, wife lending, adultery, robbery, ritual killing etc. the perverse are an abomination to the Lord. He overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah because of perversity. He also overthrew the Canaanites because of perversity. Perversity is an affront on Gods purpose and principles.

THE BLAMELESS IN THE WAY
Men are concerned about what they want but God is concerned about how they get what they want. The way is what is concerned about. That is what labels is good or evil, righteous or wicked. Men say that the end justifies the means; but God says that the means justifies or condemns the man can concern should be to ensure that we follow the right way to our desires.

God delights in those who are blameless in their ways. To be blameless in your way means to follow God`s way. If your way is his way, He cannot fault it; because his way is perfect (psalm 18:30). To be perverse is to reject God`s way. His to choose a means of realizing desires that are contrary to the God-ordained way. God`s way is revealed in God`s word. God`s way is also embodied in Jesus, who said, I AM THE WAY.

PROVERBS 11:21
Though they join forces, the wicked will not go unpunished. But the patently of the righteous will be delivered

There are three kind of evil doers. ignorant, deceived, inertial. When people do wrong in ignorance, the lord may overlook it (Acts 17). After someone has known the truth, he may do evil due to allurement of the flesh and UN watchfulness. He is not an intentional evil doer. He wants to do right but doer the wrong thing out of spiritual weakness. That is a sinner that needs correction. The reason God will punish the wicked is because he is an intentional evil. He knows the truth, reject and chooses the wrong way.

Not only does he scorn those who do right, he recruits others to join him in evil doing. He cannot be overlook or merely corrected. He is to be punished. To punish is to reward with pain. It is to inflict pain, intentionally to another for wrong doing. The wicked is an impenitent sinner.

THOUGH THEY JOIN FORCES
There are times when the wicked may run to the righteous to join forces with him. Though it happens, that does not make the wicked to be the righteous. God does not overlook the wicked because he joined forces with the righteous. In Genesis 14, Abram joined forces with Sodom against the king Elam because of time lot his reflow God delivered Lot but He still destroyed Sodom at the fullness of time. in chronicles 18 or 1kings 22 king Jehoshaphat joined forces with Ahab against Syria. Perhaps Ahab reasoned that the co-operation of Jehoshaphat would attract God`s presence. Although he joined forces with Jehoshaphat, he was punished. He died in battle. God`s justice is not sentimental or emotional. The alliance of the righteous with wicked does not the wicked is no longer wicked. The wicked man will die even if he goes to church and every one prays for him whereas the wicked must be punished, the posterity of the righteous will be delivered. God knows how to separate the righteous from the wickedeven if they join forces. God delivered Jehoshaphat but Ahab killed.
