## About Find A Ministry

FIND A MINISTRY is a Platform for Finding Churches, Ministers, and Ministries and Helping them to Find You and Yours. Show your Ministry! Find Ministries!! Connect to Ministries!!!
 

We live in a world sworn to dismantle all barriers to information, connectivity, and information (or idea) sharing. Thank God for the Internet; and for Google, YouTube, Hangouts, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Tweeter, LinkedIn, and for their likes who are helping us find what or who weâ€™re looking as well as helping others to find us. The purpose of this website is to create a pool and search engine for Christian ministries that makes it possible, and easier, for established or emerging ministries to both get found and find other ministries. It's a place to see others and be seen by them.
